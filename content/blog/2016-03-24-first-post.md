title: Testing different syntax highlighting plugins for WP
---

This post is used to test the different syntax highlighting plugins for WP and to check which plugin syntax breaks the Jetpack markdown rendering.

This block is formatted by [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) using markdown syntax:
```groovy
def x = "Hello"
def y = "World"

println "$x $y"
```
Lorem Ipsum `code tag`
