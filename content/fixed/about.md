Hi, I'm Kevin Wittek. I live in Gelsenkirchen, Germany and consider myself a musician and software engineer. I'm a entrepreneur (building backend services for mobile apps and stuff) and employee (building backend services for stuff at <a href="https://www.gdata.de/" target="_blank">GDATA</a>) alike and received my masters degree in computer science in 2015 at the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20" src="http://groovy-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gitarre-zeche-278x300.png" alt="About me" width="278" height="300" />
